Next.js Blog Website Code Guidelines

1. Project Structure
   Use a clean and modular directory structure:
   bash
   Copy code
   /src  
    ├── /pages  
    ├── /components  
    ├── /lib  
    ├── /styles  
    ├── /public  
    ├── /utils  
    └── /hooks  
   Guidelines:
   Pages Directory:

Use file-based routing.
Avoid deep nesting; max 2 levels under /pages.
Components Directory:

Split components into reusable (/components) and page-specific (/pages).
Use PascalCase for React component filenames: BlogCard.tsx.
Lib Directory:

Place external API calls, database interactions, or reusable logic.
Prefix functions with clear purpose, e.g., fetchPosts or updatePost.
Utils Directory:

Store helper functions (e.g., dateFormatter.ts).
Group utility files logically: stringUtils.ts, arrayUtils.ts.
Styles Directory:

Use global CSS, modules, or Tailwind CSS (avoid inline styles).
Maintain a single /globals.css or /tailwind.css file for global rules. 2. Code Conventions
General Coding Standards
Follow ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent formatting.
Use TypeScript:
Define types for components, props, and API responses in a dedicated /types folder.
Use interface for objects and type for simple unions.
Naming Conventions
File Naming:
Use lowercase for API routes: /pages/api/posts.ts.
Use hyphenated filenames for non-component files: blog-fetcher.ts.
Variables:
Use camelCase: blogPostCount.
Constants:
Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE: MAX_BLOG_LENGTH.
Code Comments
Use JSDoc comments for functions and complex logic. Example:
tsx
Copy code
/\*\*

- Fetches blog posts from the API.
- @param {number} limit - Number of posts to fetch.
- @returns {Promise<Post[]>} A promise resolving to an array of posts.
  \*/
  export const fetchPosts = async (limit: number): Promise<Post[]> => { ... }

3. API and Data Management
   API Routes
   Place all API endpoints in /pages/api.
   Use RESTful principles: /api/posts, /api/posts/[id].
   Always validate requests using libraries like zod or Joi.
   Data Fetching
   Use getStaticProps and getStaticPaths for static blogs.
   Use getServerSideProps only for dynamic updates on page load.
   Decision Matrix:

Data Type Method Use Case Example
Static Content getStaticProps Blog list, single blog page
Dynamic Content getServerSideProps User comments or live updates 4. SEO and Accessibility
SEO
Use the next/head component to define meta tags. Example:
tsx
Copy code

<Head>
  <title>{post.title} | My Blog</title>
  <meta name="description" content={post.excerpt} />
</Head>
Implement structured data (Schema.org JSON-LD) for blogs.
Accessibility
Use semantic HTML: <article>, <section>, <h1> for headings.
Add alt attributes to all images.
Ensure focus states are visible for interactive elements.
5. Performance and Optimisation
Image Optimisation: Use next/image with lazy loading.
Font Loading: Use next/font for optimised Google Fonts.
Code Splitting: Use dynamic imports:
tsx
Copy code
const BlogCard = dynamic(() => import('../components/BlogCard'));
Performance Checklist:

✅ Use gzip or brotli compression.
✅ Avoid large dependencies; monitor bundle size with Bundle Analyzer.
✅ Optimise third-party scripts with async or defer. 6. Testing and CI/CD
Testing
Use Jest for unit testing and React Testing Library for component tests.
Write tests for:
Components rendering.
API responses.
Data-fetching functions.
CI/CD
Integrate GitHub Actions:
Run ESLint, Prettier, and Jest tests on pull requests.
Automate deployments with Vercel. 7. Deployment Guidelines
Use Vercel for Next.js deployments.
Define environment variables securely using .env.local and Vercel secrets. 8. Security Standards
Avoid direct database connections in /pages/api.
Sanitize user inputs (use libraries like xss-clean).
Use Content-Security-Policy headers. 9. Glossary
Static Site Generation (SSG): Pre-rendering pages at build time.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Rendering pages on the server for every request.
API Routes: Backend functionality in Next.js under /pages/api.
JSDoc: Documentation standard for JavaScript/TypeScript.
Next Steps

Review and refine constraints for clarity.
Integrate specific use-case examples where needed.
